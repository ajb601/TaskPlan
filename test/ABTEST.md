A/B Tests  
Test 1
A/B Test Name:  Shortening the Sign Up Screen
User Story Number:  US 1
Metric (from the HEART grid):  Average App Usage
Hypothesis:  Changing the Sign Up/Sign In Screen will increase usage by having less screens 
Experiment:  By changing the app design and selecting our most active users, we will see if the average app usage goes up if they spend less time trying to get to where they need to be. Happier users will more likely stay on the app longer.
Variations:  The current version has three screens, one dedicated to choose either sign up or in, one to sign in, and one to sign up. By combining the three, we are making it easier for people to use the app without too much of a hassle. The improved version will have a button to choose between signing up and signing in and a switch that allows you to save your information.

Test 2  
A/B Test Name: Task Input Layouts  
User Story Number: US 2  
Metric (from the HEART grid): Tasks per day  
Hypothesis: Changing the layout and/or order of the inputs will increase the rate at which users create tasks.  
Experiment: Using firebase backend we will track the tasks created by users as object tasks over the course of a month. Half the user base will have the current layout and the other half will have the improved layout. This way we will be able to check the difference in amount of tasks made for each half of the user base in the time given.
Variations: The improved layout will have the location input closer to the bottom of the screen but still above what days it repeats if any, and have a slider to determine if the location data should be used for travel time. Additionally the checkboxes for what days of the week the task should repeat will be split in two columns, the first being Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and the second column being Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. The current layout has location in the middle of the inputs and has no toggle for if the location should be used or not. Additionally the current version has the weekend on the left and all weekdays on the right in more uneven columns.
