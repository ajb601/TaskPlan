Test 2  
A/B Test Name: Task Input Layouts  
User Story Number: US 2  
Metric (from the HEART grid): Tasks per day  
Hypothesis: Changing the layout and/or order of the inputs will increase the rate at which users create tasks.  
Experiment: Using firebase backend we will track the tasks created by users as object tasks over the course of a month. Half the user base will have the current layout and the other half will have the improved layout. This way we will be able to check the difference in amount of tasks made for each half of the user base in the time given.
Variations: The improved layout will have the location input closer to the bottom of the screen but still above what days it repeats if any, and have a slider to determine if the location data should be used for travel time. Additionally the checkboxes for what days of the week the task should repeat will be split in two columns, the first being Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday, and the second column being Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. The current layout has location in the middle of the inputs and has no toggle for if the location should be used or not. Additionally the current version has the weekend on the left and all weekdays on the right in more uneven columns.
